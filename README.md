### Submission Procedure

Submission will be on GitHub. Please follow these steps to submit your work:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone/fork the provided GitHub repository (link will be shared with you).
2.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your work. Use a naming convention like `feature/your-name-submission`.
3.  **Commit History**: 
    -   Commit often with meaningful messages. We check commit history to see your development process.
4.  **README**: Update the `README.md` with:
    -   Instructions to run the app locally.
    -   Link to the live deployment (Vercel/Netlify).
    -   Brief explanation of any major technical decisions.
5.  **Deploy**: Deploy your branch to Vercel or Netlify (you can connect your fork or branch).
6.  **Open a Pull Request**: Open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    -   Include the live deployment link in the PR description.
    -   Add a brief summary of your implementation.

### Final Instruction 

> “Replicate the Luminary ‘Cyber Command’ dashboard as closely as possible using the provided figma file.  
> You have till 28th November, 2025 | 23:00hr.  
> Push your code to a public GitHub repository and deploy it live on Vercel.  
> Send us the live link + repo URL when you’re done or when time is up (partial solutions are accepted).  
> This test measures attention to detail, Tailwind mastery, Next.js 14+ App Router fluency, and overall code quality — exactly what we need for our agency’s high-end clients.”
